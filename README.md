# Unnamed game project for Fundamentals of Computer Graphics
Ideas:
- shooter
- low poly
- crunchy pixels


To do:
- [x] Refactor code using Model and ObjModel classes
- [x] Unify Model into one class
- [x] Implement custom .obj loading
- [x] Cap frame buffer swapping to FPS
- [x] Abstract window into class
- [x] Create input handler
- [x] Implement base for command design pattern [source](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html)
- [x] Implement all basic movement commands
- [x] Fix frame buffer issue
- [ ] Reimplement mouse movement
- [ ] Improve Model and Obj loading abstraction (abstract glcalls into Renderer?)
- [ ] Improve VAO abstraction
- [ ] Display abstraction? (Separate graphic actions from game actions)
- [ ] Add textures drawing and texture data loading from .obj
- [ ] Add lighting and material data loading from .obj
- [ ] Improve debug tools
